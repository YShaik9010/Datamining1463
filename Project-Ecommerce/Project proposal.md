#PROJECT PROPOSAL:
E-commerce websites often ask their customers to review the products that they sell. As E-commerce is becoming popular day by day, the number of customer reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. The number of reviews can be in hundreds or even thousands, depending on the product. It becomes difficult for a person to read all the reviews and take a decision. It also becomes difficult for the manufacturer of the product to keep track and to manage customer opinions. In this project, we aim to mine all the customer reviews of a particular product and summarize them. This summarization task that is performed is different from traditional text summarization, as only the features of the product are mined. These are the opinions of the customers, which may be positive or negative. Reviews are not summarized by selecting a subset or rewrite some of the original sentences from the reviews to capture the main points as in the classic text summarization. The entire task is divided into three steps:
 (1) Mining the product features that are commented by the customers.
(2) Identifying the opinion sentences of the customers in all the reviews and telling whether each opinion sentence is either positive or negative.
(3) Summarizing these results.
 This project proposes several novel techniques to perform these tasks. The experimental results using reviews of a number of products sold online demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques.

#OVERVIEW: 
Here we will be be doing analysis on peopleâ€™s opinions about the products. The reviews will be either positive or negative opinions. These reviews will be useful for business analysts to have an idea about their products which is like a feedback. 

#DATASET: 
The datasets for this analysis will be the reviews given by the customers regarding the products. The reviews can be either positive or negative depending upon the customers opinions.
